# Prelim Laboratory Exam - MataBayan Disaster Alert System

## Implemented Features Summary

- **Ticket 5:** Account Creation and Login on Front-End Development  
- **Ticket 6:** MataBayan Disaster Dashboard  
- **Ticket 7:** Database Creation  

In this sprint, we implemented several key features for MataBayan. **Ticket 5** focused on account creation and login, allowing users to register and securely access the system through the front-end interface. **Ticket 6** involved setting up the MataBayan Disaster Dashboard, laying the foundation for displaying disaster-related information in future development. **Ticket 7** covered database creation, where we structured the MongoDB database to store user information securely and prepare for future integration of disaster data and system features.

## Coding Standards Applied

- **Consistent Naming Conventions**  
- **Comments and Documentation**  
- **Security Best Practices**  

We followed consistent coding standards by using clear naming conventions, adding comments and documentation for important logic, and applying security best practices. Variables and functions use readable names, React components are clearly labeled, and critical sections like authentication are documented. Security measures such as password hashing and input validation were integrated to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.
